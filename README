This will repro issue with increasing storage entries in a distributor scenario in NSB 3.3.5. You need two machines to test this, A and B.
The scenario is a simple distributor with a single worker. The only thing the worker do is hook up to it's distributor and it has a messagehandler that subscribes to it's OWN event.

1) Download this code
2) Update masternode/distributor machine name and message mapping in app.config for Orders.Handler.Worker1 to point to A.
3) Build
4) Copy Orders.Handler(this is the distributor) to machine A and Orders.Handler.Worker1 to machine B
5) Start Orders.Handler on A with NServiceBus.Host.Exe NServiceBus.Integration NServiceBus.Distributor
6) Start Orders.Handler.Worker1 on B with NServiceBus.Host.Exe NServiceBus.Integration NServiceBus.Worker

Both start up, and you get the expected result: 5 entries in the Orders.Handler.Distributor.Storage queue on A.

7) Kill Orders.Handler.Worker1 on B and restart it.

Now you end up with a incorrect result: 6 entries in Orders.Handler.Distributor.Storage. This is clearly wrong, restarting Orders.Handler.Worker1 on B should have reset the storage entries for it to 5.

If you PURGE Orders.Handler.Distributor.Storage between 6) and 7), everything works as expected.

If you add another handler in Orders.Handler.Worker1 that subscribes to another event you will get 7 entries in Orders.Handler.Distributor.Storage. Another, you get 8 etc etc.
